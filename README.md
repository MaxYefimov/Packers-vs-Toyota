# Packers Games vs. Toyota Stock Analysis

### By Max

This is a fun, exploratory data project investigating the joke connection between Jordan Love's performance during "Toyotathon" season and the Toyota stock price. The goal of the project was to create content that could be used in a data-based social media post for the Packers fan account **@lambeau.Leapers**.

---

## Project Summary

The project explores the question:  
**Does the performance or timing of Packers games — specifically Jordan Love’s — have any effect on Toyota’s stock price?**

Result: No.  
But in exploring the data, I discovered one highly entertaining statistical coincidence:

> After the Packers clinched a playoff spot on **December 24, 2024**, Toyota stock jumped **9.4%** in the two trading days that followed.

A coincidence but a good example of data-driven content with a twist for social media.

## Project Structure
 
  Jupyter Notebook with the full step-by-step analysis, including:
  - Data cleaning and formatting
  - Visualizations
  - Calculation of Daily and Cumulative Returns
  - Packers game overlays
  - Final conclusions and post idea

---

## Key Topics

- Stock data cleaning and slicing (Pandas)
- Date/time manipulation
- Daily return vs. cumulative return
- Visual storytelling (Matplotlib/Seaborn)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

---

## Findings

- Sometimes your initial hypothesis falls apart — and that’s okay.
- Even “failed” analyses can lead to great creative content.
- Cumulative return > simply adding percentages.

---

## Future Additions

- Compare Toyota stock to **Packers wins/losses** directly.
- Track **Jordan Love’s QB rating** vs. daily stock trends.
- More advanced financial metrics (e.g., beta, volatility).
